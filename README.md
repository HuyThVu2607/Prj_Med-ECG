##ECG 12 LEADS Project
##Overview
-This project is a 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) system built using the ADS1298 analog front-end (AFE) for biopotential measurements and the nRF5340 microcontroller for processing and wireless communication. The project aims to provide a basic framework for ECG signal acquisition, processing, and transmission over wireless protocols.

--Note: This project is a draft only and is not meant to be a final or production-level design.

##Key Features
-12-lead ECG system using ADS1298.
-Wireless communication using nRF5340.
-Modular and expandable hardware architecture.
-Data transmission for remote monitoring.

##Hardware
-ADS1298: A low-power, 8-channel, 24-bit analog front-end for ECG and other biopotential measurements.
-nRF5340: Dual-core Bluetooth 5.2 SoC with advanced wireless connectivity and high-performance processing.
